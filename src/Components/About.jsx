              Growing up, I spent a lot of time exploring my small Michigan town, and the surrounding beaches and forests. I grew to be fascinated with snakes and other animals, and would try and draw the pictures I would see in different books. In High School, my interests drifted towards Sci-Fi/Fantasy games and movies. Itâ€™s also when I started to push my art abilities, and fell in love with using black and white. Eventually, I moved to Chicago, which is where I live today. As far as my art goes, I want to keep pushing my skills with pen and Ink, while branching out into some digital stuff as well. Regardless, thanks for checking out my stuff!
