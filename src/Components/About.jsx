            Growing up, I spent a lot of time exploring my small Michigan town, and the surrounding beaches and forests. I grew to be fascinated with snakes and other animals, and would try and draw the pictures I would see in different books. In High School, my interests drifted towards Sci-Fi/Fantasy games and movies. Itâ€™s also when I started to push my art abilities, and fell in love with using black and white. Eventually, I moved to Chicago, which is where I live today. As far as my art goes, I want to keep pushing my skills with pen and Ink, while branching out into some digital stuff as well. If anyone would like to reach out with any questions, please reach out to me at mcduffartanddesign@gmail.com. Regardless, thanks for checking out my stuff!
